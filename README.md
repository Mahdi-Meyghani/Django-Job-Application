# Job Application Form Web App

This web application is built using Django and HTML. It allows users to fill out a job application form and submit their details. Upon submission, the app sends a confirmation email to the user and stores the data in an SQL database.

## Features

- **Job Application Form**: Users can fill out a form with their first name, last name, email, start date, and current occupation.
- **Email Confirmation**: Upon form submission, the app sends a congratulatory email to the user using Django's email functionality.
- **Data Storage**: User data is stored in an SQL database managed by Django.
- **Success Message**: After submission, users receive a success message on the web page.
- **Admin Interface**: Admins can log in at `/admin/` to view, edit, delete, and search user data. Admins can also filter data by date and occupation.
- **Navigation Bar**: The app includes an About page and a Contact page. Users can send messages via the Contact page, which also uses Django to send emails.
